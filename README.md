# Notice

Please see [m2njs](https://github.com/wbellan/m2njs)!

Since taking over this abandoned project, I have updated the source, and republished under m2njs. You can install the latest version of this Mongrel2 handler for Node.js with npm:

```bash
npm install mongrel2
```

# node-mongrel2

A Mongrel2 handler for nodejs.

## Howto

This isn't an intro to Mongrel2. Try the [Mongrel2 Manual](http://mongrel2.org/doc/tip/docs/manual/book.wiki) for that.

Install with npm:

    % npm install mongrel2

Use it in your code:

    var mongrel2 = require('mongrel2');

    // mongrel2.connect(recv_spec, send_spec, identify, callback)
    // recv_spec is what you configure as your send_spec in your mongrel2.conf
    // send_spec is vice versa
    mongrel2.connect('tcp://127.0.0.1:9997', 'tcp://127.0.0.1:9996', 'test', function(msg, reply) {
      // do some logic
      reply(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }, "Hello, World!\n" + JSON.stringify(msg));
    });
